#Issue 1:

the installation on a PC with windows 7 leads to the following error :
pip install myqlm
Collecting myqlm
Using cached myqlm-1.1.6-py3-none-any.whl (1.8 kB)
Using cached myqlm-1.1.5-py3-none-any.whl (1.6 kB)
ERROR: Cannot install myqlm==1.1.5 and myqlm==1.1.6 because these package versio
ns have conflicting dependencies.
The conflict is caused by:
myqlm 1.1.6 depends on qat-comm>=1.1.6
myqlm 1.1.5 depends on qat-core>=1.2.5
