# Guidelines for reporting issues in myQLM

We are using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/myQLM/myqlm-issues/issues) for tracking bugs and issues. To report a new issue you need to go to the tab [New issue](https://github.com/myQLM/myqlm-issues/issues/new) and submit your issue.  
You can also use our [Slack](https://myqlmworkspace.slack.com/?redir=%2Fgantry%2Fclient) for simple questions and discussion on quantum computation and myQLM.
