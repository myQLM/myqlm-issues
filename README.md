# Guidelines for reporting issues in myQLM

We are using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/myQLM/myqlm-issues/issues) for tracking bugs and issues. To report a bug, from the "New issue" tab go to  [bug report](https://github.com/myQLM/myqlm-issues/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) and submit your issue. You can also suggest us different ideas for myQLM from the tab [Feature request](https://github.com/myQLM/myqlm-issues/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=) .   
You can also use our [Slack](https://myqlmworkspace.slack.com/?redir=%2Fgantry%2Fclient) for simple questions and discussion on quantum computation and myQLM.
